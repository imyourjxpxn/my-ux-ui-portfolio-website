        <h2>üéì How It Started</h2>
        <p>One of the most exciting experiences I had was joining the KU Startup Bootcamp, where students from different campuses came together to brainstorm innovative business ideas.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the program, we were randomly grouped and given a challenge: come up with a startup idea that solves a real-world problem.</p>
        
        <h3>üí° From Brainstorming to Business Idea</h3>
        <p>Our team started by discussing various social issues, and one common theme stood out‚Äîour grandparents.</p>
        <p>We realized that many of us had elderly family members who struggled with boredom, loneliness, and a lack of engaging digital activities. Some of them wanted to play games but found most mobile games too fast, confusing, or difficult to use.</p>
        <p>This inspired us to create Senior Play‚Äîa mobile game app designed specifically for seniors, focusing on accessibility, cognitive engagement, and social connection.</p>

        <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
        <p>For this project, we took a unique approach to understanding the needs of elderly users by performing Assumption Mapping. We hypothesized the potential pain points and needs that seniors might face while engaging with mobile apps, specifically in the context of gaming and cognitive engagement. This method allowed us to form educated assumptions about how the target audience would interact with a game app and what challenges they might encounter.</p>

          <img src={Assumption_map} alt="Assumption Mapping" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
        </div>
        
        <p>Through Assumption Mapping, we identified key areas to focus on:</p>
        <ul className="insights-list">
          <li>The need for simplicity in design and navigation.</li>
          <li>The importance of games that stimulate memory and cognitive skills.</li>
          <li>The potential for fostering social connections within the app, as isolation is a major issue for many elderly individuals.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Once we had our assumptions mapped out, we then looked at the market fit by analyzing existing apps targeted at the elderly. We evaluated their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the user experience, which helped us refine the features we would include in Senior Play.</p>
